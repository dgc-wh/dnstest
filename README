Hello, and welcome.  Given that so many people are encountering DNS hijacking 
it's actually a good thing to, you know, pay attention to where your DNS is 
pointing.  So that's what this does.  Here's the instructions:

1) Make sure you have Net::DNS installed.  If not, use cpan and type 

install Net::DNS

2) Edit dnstable.dat and remove the example and replace it with your own.  Make 
sure you use tabs to delimit the strings. Feel free to fork it the code and 
make it do whatever you want to support additional features if you need them.
The syntax is:

hostname<tab>IP address<newline>
hostname2<tab>IP address2<newline>
...

3) Edit dnstest.pl and change the lines $config to match the path of your
configuration file.  And change the $mail to be your email address where you
want alerts sent.

4) Add it to crontab (using crontab -e) with a string similar to this:

0 * * * * /usr/bin/perl /path/to/dnstest.pl >/dev/null

This will run it once an hour, at the top of the hour.  You can change it to
whatever works best for you, of course.   You can also run this out of nagios
or similar apps if you want.

5) TEST IT!  Change dnstable.dat to an incorrect IP address and wait for the 
alert to come in.  If it doesn't come in within an hour, you've messed 
something up.

6) Sit back, relax, pour yourself a Mai Thai, get some tanning lotion and let 
dnstable.pl do the work for you!  There.  I've replaced an annoying job with a 
very short Perl script.  You're welcome.

xoxo
